DexSync is your ultimate gateway to decentralized finance (DeFi). Seamlessly navigate the complexities of DeFi trading and experience a secure, affordable, and accessible way to explore the world of crypto.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Integration Challenge**  
During DexSync's development, a significant challenge was integrating the platform across diverse blockchain networks. Unique architectures and data variations led to compatibility issues and data synchronization hurdles.

**Solution 1: Middleware Layer**  
A middleware layer was introduced to abstract blockchain intricacies, enabling DexSync to communicate seamlessly with different chains. This eased compatibility concerns.

**Solution 2: Bos Components Integration**  
Despite challenges, I'm committed to integrating Bos components into the main app. Due to time and resource constraints during the hackathon, this task is planned after the event. Expect exciting new features to enhance DexSync soon!
